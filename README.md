# snappytemplate

Hello!

My name is Shane and I am an iOS developer!

This project contains a base template for my personal apps

It is built in UIKit and features a Local  Storage component as well

The Coding Architecture is MVP (Modal View Presenter)

Over time, I will be making modifications to this repo to support things like SwiftUI and other enhancements

Be on the look out! :)
